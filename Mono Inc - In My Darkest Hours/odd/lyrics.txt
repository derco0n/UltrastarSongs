I'd like to thank you sweet love
It never felt so~ good
I asked you to believe in me
But never thought you would
Be with me when I'm breaking down
And warm me for a while
But nothing's made forever, oh no
So kiss me dear
Before we say goodbye

And today will stay forever in my mind
On all my ways and all my darkest hours
I'll dream back here
So say goodbye
'Cause tonight will stay forever in my head
For all my life on all those painful days
I swear I won't forget

I'd like to thank you sweet love
For your benignancy
It's been a while to starting out now
It's been a fight for me
Oh, truly when I look at you
I see the reasons why
I gotta take the outbound bus
So sing with me
Before we say goodbye

'Cause today will stay forever in my mind
On all my ways and all my darkest hours
I'll dream back here
So say goodbye
'Cause tonight will stay forever in my head
For all my life on all those painful days
I swear I won't forget

I'd like to thank you sweet love
It never felt so good
It's been a while since starting out now  ; - (In der live-version im Text vertan..)
But never thought you would
Be with me when I'm breaking down
And warm me for a while
But nothings made for ever, oh no
So kiss me dear
Before we say goodbye

And today will stay forever in my mind
On all my ways and all my darkest hours
I'll dream back here
So say goodbye

'Cause tonight will stay forever in my head
For all my life on all those painful days
I swear I won't forget
No, I won't forget
