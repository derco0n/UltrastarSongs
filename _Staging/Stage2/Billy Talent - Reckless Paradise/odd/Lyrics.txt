Stuck in a crisis
Without a conscience
Trapped in a place we don't belong
There's no more heroes
Left to believe in
They've pushed our backs against the wall
I know that something has to change
We got lost along the way
Your thoughts and plans can't fix the pain
'Cause we're falling down again
Crooks and deceivers
Misled by leaders
Our worldwide decency is gone
Chaotic flashes
Of huddled masses
Stare down the barrel of the gun
I know that something has to change
We got lost along the way
Your thoughts and plans can't fix the pain
'Cause we're falling down again
Bled in a reckless paradise
The house is burning, we're trapped inside
Our reckless paradise
The wheels are turning to tie eyes
In reckless paradise
Couldn't cut the tentson with a knife
In reckless paradise
It's up to us to read between the lines
Your thoughts and plans can't fix the pain
'Cause we're falling down again
Reckless paradise
The house is burning, we're trapped inside
Our reckless paradise
The wheels are turning to tie eyes
In reckless paradise
Couldn't cut the tentson with a knife
In reckless paradise
It's up to us to read between the lines
Your thoughts and plans can't fix the pain
'Cause we're falling down again


Adjusted:
Stuck in a cri+sis
With+out a consc+ience
Trap+ped in a place we don't be+long
There's no more he+roes
Left to be+lieve in
They've push+ed our backs a+gainst the wall
I know that some+thing has to change
We got lost a+long the way
Your thoughts and plans can't fix the pain
'Cause we're fal+ling down a+gain
Crooks and de+cei+vers
Misled be+lie+vers
Our world ehre de+cen+cy is gone
Chao+tic fla+shes
Of hud+dled mas+ses
Stare down the bar+rel of the gun
I know that some+thing has to change
We got lost a+long the way
Your thoughts and prayers can't fix the pain
'Cause we're fal+ling down a+gain
Live in a reck+less pa+ra+dise
The house is bur+ning, trap+ped in+side
A reck+less pa+ra+dise
The wheels are tur+ning truth to lies
In reck+less pa+ra+dise
Could cut the ten+tion with a knife
In reck+less pa+ra+dise
It's up to us to read bet+ween the lines
Your thoughts and prayers can't fix the pain
'Cause we're fal+ling down a+gain
Reck+less pa+ra+dise
The house is bur+ning, trap+ped in+side
A reck+less pa+ra+dise
The wheels are tur+ning truth to lies
in reck+less pa+ra+dise
Could cut the ten+tion with a knife
in reck+less pa+ra+dise
It's up to us to read bet+ween the lines
Your thoughts and prayers can't fix the pain
'Cause we're fal+ling down ag+ain
