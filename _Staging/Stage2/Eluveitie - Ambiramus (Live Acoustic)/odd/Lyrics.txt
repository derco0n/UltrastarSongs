Somewhere afar
A cry rang out
Wondrous words echoing
In my restless heart
A call I heard
In three different tongues
Of such awing majesty
Soft and silently
Whispering my name
I could not oppose
And so I set out into the unknown
I spread my arms to fall...
Ambiramus
Cicinxiet mon textā
Cover me in your darkest shelter
Ad magos meldíās
Ambiteixtū ad tīros íovincon
I have lost control
And drift afar
Into a darkness arcane
All that I've known
Blurred into a pale
And distant memory
And so I set out into the unknown
I spread my arms to fall...
Ambiramus
Cicinxiet mon textā
Cover me in your darkest shelter
Ad magos meldíās
Ambiteixtū ad tīros íovincon
And I spread my arms to fall...

Some+where a+far
A cry ra~ng ou~t
Wond+rous words e+cho+ing
In my rest+less hea~rt
A call I hea~rd
In three diff+erent ton+gues
Of such a+wing ma+jes+ty
Soft and si+lent+ly
Whis+pe+ring my na~me
I cou~ld not op+pose
And so I set out in+to the un+known
I spread my arms to fa~ll...
Am+bi+ra+mus
Co+ver me in your dark+est shel+ter
I have lost con+trol
And drift a+far
Into a da~rk+ness ar+cane
All that I've known
Blur+red in+to a pale
And dis+tant me+mo+ry
And so I set out in+to the un+known
I spread my arms to fa~ll...
Am+bi+ra+mus
Co+ver me in your dark+est shel+ter
And I spread my arms to fa~ll...

Co+ver me in your dark+est shel+ter
