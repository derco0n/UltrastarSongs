I'm in love with the mornin' light, feel it deep inside
My day, my time, my way
But you never stay for the night, you don't know me like
One day I wish you would, yeah
Everybody thinks that I'm just a fuckboy (fuckboy, fuckboy)
'Cause I know that you think that I'm just a fuckboy (just a fuckboy)
I know that I don't have any good reputation
Do you wanna be my way out of this situation?
But I really wanna know that you want me
I really wanna show that I'm worth it
'Cause I know, 'cause I know
I'm better, I'm good for you
Yeah, everybody thinks that I'm just a fuckboy (just a fuckboy)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I know that you think that I'm just a fuckboy (just a fuckboy)
(Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Callin' me late, you're gettin' under my skin
And you're showin' up at my place for days
Well, I think I like it
'Cause you stay in my head where rent is free
When you call my name, it hits differently
I need to know, need to know, are you good for me?
Yeah, everybody thinks that you're just a fuckboy
Well, maybe you're not good for me
Everybody thinks that you're just a fuckboy
I can't really help but feel
I don't care what they say, boy, I need you to stay
Yeah, I want you so bad in all the worst ways
Everybody thinks that you're just a fuckboy
Yeah, well, I don't give a fuck, boy
Why they keep talkin' shit when no one fuckin' asked?
You know I love to watch your eyes roll back
You had a taste, and now you're fiendin' 'cause you like that
You fuck around, boy, you should know I'm gonna bite back
I don't care what they say 'cause I need you to stay
Yeah, I want you so bad in all the worst ways
I don't care what they say 'cause I need you to stay
Yeah, I want (I want you so bad in all the worst ways)
Yeah, everybody thinks that I'm just a fuckboy
No matter what they say, I wanna be with you
'Cause I know that you think that I'm just a fuckboy
So, baby, tell me lies 'cause I don't need the truth
Give 'em somethin' to say 'cause I need you to stay
Yeah, I want you so bad in all the worst ways
Yeah, everybody thinks that I'm just a fuckboy
So come here 'cause I don't give a fuck, boy
