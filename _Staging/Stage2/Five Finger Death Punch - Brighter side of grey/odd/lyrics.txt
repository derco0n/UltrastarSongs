I'm writing this in case I'm gone tomorrow
I'm writing this in case I've moved along
There's something that I hope you'll remember
That life is not a game, it's a song
So take the best parts of me
Locked away without the keys
And know that I'm forever by your side
When the lights go down
Know that I am never far away
When the sun burns out
I'll be waiting on the brighter side of grey
If you're reading this, I know you're feeling sorrow
If you're hearing this, I know you're probably scared
Just know that all the things you want are borrowed
And all you get to keep is all you've shared
So wipe away the tears for me
Know that we've made history
Remember no one ever really dies
When the lights go down
Know that I am never far away
When the sun burns out
I'll be waiting on the brighter side of grey
When the lights go down
Know that I am never far away
When the sun burns out
I'll be waiting on the brighter side of grey
