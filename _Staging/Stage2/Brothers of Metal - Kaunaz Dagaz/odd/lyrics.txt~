Hear the call for all and the chosen ones
Far away, but all like one
Come together, we've just begun
Chant till Valhalla comes
Chanting till Valhalla comes
Arise
Into the final battle
There's a fire in my blood
Let's fight
Trough the shadowland
There is light to lead us all
Charging into my destiny
Hear the thunder in my heart
Fight me well and I'll be free
Defenders heeding my call
Come with me, through the fire
Burning so real
And tonight, we rise higher
Sworn to the steel
See the light, break free
In the darkest of night
Just keep on
Fighting 'til the break of dawn
'Till Valhalla comes
We strike
Out on the battlefield
There's a fire in your eyes
Ignite
Burning for your life
And the will that never dies
Charging into my destiny
Hear a thunder in my heart
Fight me well and I'll be free
Defenders heeding my call
Come with me, through the fire
Burning so real
And tonight, we rise higher
Sworn to the steel
The light, breaks free
In the darkest of night
Just keep on
Fighting 'till the break of dawn
Come with me, through the fire
Burning so real
And tonight, we rise higher
Sworn to the steel
See the light, break free
In the darkest of night
Just keep on
Riding 'til the break of dawn, fighting on
