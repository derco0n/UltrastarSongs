I spoke to God today
And she said that she's ashamed
What have I become
What have I done
I spoke to the Devil today
And he swears he's not to blame
And I understood
'Cause I feel the same
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side of hell
(I'm on) The wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side, the righteous side of hell
I heard from God today
And she sounded just like me
What have I done
And who have I become
I saw the Devil today
And he looked a lot like me
I looked away
I turned away
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side of hell
(I'm on) The wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side, the righteous side of hell
I'm not defending
Downward descending
Falling further and further away
Getting closer every day
I'm getting closer every day
To the end
To the end, the end, the end, I'm getting closer every day
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero
And I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side of hell
(I'm on) The wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side of hell
(I'm on) The wrong side of heaven
And the righteous side, righteous side of hell
