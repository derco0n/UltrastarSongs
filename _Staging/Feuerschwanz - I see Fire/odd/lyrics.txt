[Intro]
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons (sons sons)

[Verse 1]
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

[Verse 2]
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Verse 3]
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

[Chorus]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

[Bridge]
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out

[Outro]
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out)
I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin) (fire)
I see fire (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

Oh mis+ty eye of the moun+tai+~n be+low
Keep care+ful watch of my bro+the+~rs' sou+~ls
And should the sky+~ be fil+led with fi+~re and smo+~ke
Keep wat+ching o+ver Du+rin's sons (sons sons)

If this is to end in fi+re, then we should all burn to+get+her
Watch the fla+mes climb hi+~gh in+to the ni+~ght
Cal+ling out fat+her oh, stand by and we wi+~ll
Watch the fla+mes burn au+burn on the moun+tain side

And if we should die to+ni+~ght, we should all die to+get+her
Raise a glass of wi+~ne for the last time
Cal+ling out fat+her oh, pre+pare as we wi+~ll
Watch the fla+mes burn au+burn on the moun+tain side
De+so+la+tio+~n comes up+on the sky+~

Now I see fi+re, in+side the moun+tain

Oh, should my peo+ple fall then sure+ly I'll do the same
Con+fin+ed in moun+tain ha+~lls, we got too close to the fla+me
Cal+ling out fat+her oh, hold fast and we wi+~ll
Watch the fla+mes burn au+burn on the moun+tain side
De+so+la+tio+~n comes up+on the sky+~

And with that sha+dow up+on the ground I hear my peo+ple scream+ing out

Now I see fi+re, in+side the moun+tain

And I see fi+re burn au+burn on the moun+tain side
