Here I stand, helpless and left for dead
Close your eyes, so many days go by
Easy to find what's wrong, harder to find what's right
I believe in you, I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies
I won't stay long, in this world so wrong
Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Trembling, crawling across my skin
Feeling your cold dead eyes, stealing the life of mine
I believe in you, I can show you that I can see right through all your empty lies
I won't last long, in this world so wrong
Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Hold on. Hold on
Say goodbye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Don't you dare look at him in the eye, as we dance with the devil tonight
Hold on. Hold on
Goodbye
