Wide eyes, dark skies
Something's screamin' inside
So free fall into the night storm
Face your demons tonight
Oh there is no way to hide it
Now all the blood and pressure's rising
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
Running through my veins
I can feel the thunder
Tonight
Tonight
When darkness strikes
And all the hearts ignite
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I'm the heart of the hurricane
Dark stars, burning hearts
You're not alone in this fight
Just breathe in, your electric skin
Will explode into life
Oh you know that there's no way to hide it
Now all the blood and pressure's rising
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
Running through my veins
I can feel the thunder
Tonight
Tonight
When darkness strikes
And all the hearts ignite
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I'm the heart of the hurricane
Follow me, rescue me
Come with me to never let me go
Melting minds instinctively
United in the center of the storm
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I can feel the thunder
Tonight
When darkness strikes
And all the hearts ignite
I can feel the thunder
Running through my veins
I'm the heart of the hurricane
