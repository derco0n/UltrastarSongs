Here comes the barrow
Rumbling down the lane
Some call him a thief
Some said he was insane
Straining in the darkness
Sleeping in the day
That's what they say
A lifeless body in a mothy robe
A worn out hat and a perforated coat
Nobody's gonna miss him
Or gather at his grave
That's what they say
What's your name, vagabond?
Where have you been?
What's your name, vagabond?
What have you seen?
Where do you come from?
And what do you strive?
Now tell me 'bout a vagabond's life
Ashes to ashes
The glow of flambeaus
Leaves of society
He was one of those
He was living on others
Put all of us to shame
That's what they say
He walked with a limp
But he had been around
From far east to west
With a north wind down south
He was branded an outlaw
It was time to repay
That's what they say
What's your name, vagabond?
Where have you been?
What's your name, vagabond?
What have you seen?
Where do you come from?
And what did you strive?
Now tell me 'bout a vagabond's life
Don't call it murder
How can you dare?
Turn 'round and leave
You shouldn't really care
The whole case is closed in a pauper's grave
That's what they say
Rest in peace, vagabond?
Where have you been?
Rest in peace, vagabond?
What have you seen?
Where did you come from?
And what did you strive?
Now tell me 'bout a vagabond's life
Rest in peace, vagabond
Where have you been?
Rest in peace, vagabond
What have you seen?
Where did you come from?
And what did you strive?
