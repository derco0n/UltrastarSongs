# UltrastarSongs
This is a collection of Songfiles for the Opensource-Karaoke-Game Ultrastar ( https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe ).

Due to legal reasons, this will just contain the .txt-files which are used by the software to determine timings and pitched but won't contain any audio or video files.

However you might be able to provide your own audio/video as most of them can be found around the internet on sites like youtube.

The following linux-commands might come in handy for this:

- `youtube-dl --audio-quality 0 --audio-format mp3 --recode-video avi -v <VIDEO-URL>`
- `ffmpeg -i /path/to/downloaded/video.avi /path/to/target/audio.mp3`

Furthermore you can create own songs using sites like:

- https://getsongkey.com/tools/key-finder
- https://getsongbpm.com/tools/audio

And using tools like:

- Ultrastar Creator ( https://github.com/UltraStar-Deluxe/UltraStar-Creator )
- YASS ( https://yass-along.com/download/ )
