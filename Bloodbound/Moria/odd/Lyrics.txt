Bang your head to hell and back
Shaking the ground of Moria
Raise the dead our time has come
Show me the horns
Of Moria
The night has fallen
And the sky is clear
You feel the darkness
Surround you
I'll pray for mercy
When I'm 6 feet under ground
I'll pray for mercy
When eden's found
Heavenly pictures
Try to rape your mind
Tormented creatures
You will find
Bang your head to hell and back
Shaking the ground of Moria
Raise the dead our time has come
Show me the horns
Of Moria
The light is crawling
And the time is near
A touch of evil
That bind you
I'll pray for mercy
When my heart has stopped to pound
I'll pray for mercy
When hell is found
Heavenly pictures
Bang your head to hell and back
Shaking the ground of Moria
Raise the dead our time has come
Show me the horns
Of Moria
