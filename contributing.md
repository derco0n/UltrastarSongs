If you think you can create songfiles in a good quality you're welcome to fork this project and submit pull-request.
Even if a song may not be perfect, but can be a good starting point, i'm happy to receive a PR.

You may also help by gathering lyrics, correcting or adjusting them for ultrastar, fixing individual notes that might be wrong or finding keys and BPMs for songs.
If you like you may craft a duett-song from finished standard-song.

## Guidlines
- Have Fun.
- Please don't submit any sound or videofile, as they might need a licence. We want to avoid legal issues.
- Please submit your songs in the same structre as seen here
	- Folder: Artist - Song -> A folder of a finished song
		- Artist - Songname.txt -> The songfile for Ultrastar
		- Folder: odd
			- info.txt -> An file that contains information about the song's key and BPM and idealy a legal public-source (e.g. Youtube-Link) where audio- and video-files can be retrieved
			- Lyrics.txt -> The songs lyrics. These my be adjusted to be used in UltrastarCreator
	- Folder: _Staging
		- Folder: Stage 1 -> This folder may contain the first steps for a song (see info.txt for details)
		- Folder: Stage 2 -> This folder may contain further steps for a song (e.g. creating the intital tapping/layout for a song with UltrastarCreator)
- Don't submit anything that might be racist, discriminatory, terrorist or in any way illegal!!
